\section{Product Page}
This section contains the usability analysis of a product page of the website.

\subsection{Informative Axes}
The product page is considered to be an internal page. There the user is "after" the homepage,
but it is not possible to assume that he already knows everything regarding the 6w; 
in fact browsers may take him directly to an internal page (through deep linking). 
So there is the need to replicate at least the most important axes.
