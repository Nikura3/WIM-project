\section{Final evaluation}
The website has positive and negative sides, as the major part of modern commercial websites, 
following their main characteristics and trends. 
The final evaluation I would give to this website is 8 beacause there are not major problems and 
it implements some good solutions to face some typical usability problems. Still, there are some 
parts that might be imporoved from an usability point of view, like for example the amount of scrolling
required in some parts or the large number of different layouts used in the homepage.
